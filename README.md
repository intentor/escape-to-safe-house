# Escape to Safe House

*Escape to Safe House* is a 2D adventure side-scrolling platform game in which the player has to escape from a town infested by zombies to a safe house where supposedly there are survivors.

The project was originally conceived as a proof of concept for a 2D side-scrolling platform game engine in Java and as part of a game development course. Its art and gameplay elements are just sketches used to complement the concept of the game engine.
